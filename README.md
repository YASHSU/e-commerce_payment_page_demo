# e-commerce_payment_page_demo
Here you can explore the key aspects of e-commerce system design, focusing on the payment page, and provide a sample code snippet to illustrate the implementation.

This code snippet includes a simple payment form with fields for card number, expiry date, CVV, and amount. The form is styled using CSS to create a clean and modern look. The JavaScript code listens for the form submission event, validates the form data, and displays an alert message upon successful payment.
